{"name":"linter-liquidhaskell","main":"./lib/init","version":"0.3.0","description":"Lint Haskell code with LiquidHaskell","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/ranjitjhala/linter-liquidhaskell.git"},"license":"MIT","engines":{"atom":">=1.0"},"dependencies":{"xregexp":">=2.0.0 <=3.0.0"},"providedServices":{"linter":{"versions":{"1.0.0":"provideLinter"}}},"readme":"# linter-liquid\n\nThis package will lint your opened Haskell in Atom, using [liquidhaskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/liquidhaskell).\n\n![linter-liquidhaskell in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranjitjhala/linter-liquidhaskell/master/screenshot.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n* Install [liquidhaskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/liquidhaskell)\n* `$ apm install linter` (if you don't have [AtomLinter/Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) installed)\n* `$ apm install language-haskell` (for [Haskell syntax highlighting](https://github.com/jroesch/language-haskell) installed)\n* `$ apm install linter-liquidhaskell`\n* Specify the path to `liquid` in the settings.  You can find the path by using `which liquid` in the terminal\n\n## TODO\n\nNeed to check integration with `stack` -- currently doesn't work if you set\n`useStack` but are in a *non-stack* directory.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n1. Since the plugin needs to run `liquid` you must either have it in your\n   path, or provide the full path as described above. The latter is recommended\n   especially if you run `atom` from outside a shell (e.g. by the result of\n   \"spotlight search\" on MacOS).\n\n\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ranjitjhala/linter-liquidhaskell/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ranjitjhala/linter-liquidhaskell#readme","_id":"linter-liquidhaskell@0.3.0","_shasum":"40f543473e1c6984b6e9cd1614dc1e0f77e853c8","_resolved":"file:../d-116513-3309-1ahkmh6/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116513-3309-1ahkmh6/package.tgz"}
