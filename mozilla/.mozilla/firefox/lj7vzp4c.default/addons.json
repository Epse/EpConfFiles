Gets rid of a site's cookies and LocalStorage as soon as you close its tabs. Protects against trackers and zombie-cookies. Trustworthy services can be whitelisted.","fullDescription":"Self-Destructing Cookies is not just a cookie manager, it's a new cookie policy. Do you think that cookies should need a reason to persist in your cookie jar, i.e. you currently interacting with the site that set them? Would you prefer your cookie jar to be empty in its steady state, except for a few sites that you care about? Are you worried about unconventional tracking methods? Then give this add-on a try.\n\nSelf-Destructing Cookies automatically removes cookies when they are no longer used by open browser tabs. With the cookies, lingering sessions, as well as information used to spy on you, will be expunged. Websites will only be permitted to identify you while you actually use them and can not stalk you across the entire web. This is the closest you will get to cookieless browsing without breaking every second site or tedious micromanaging.\n\nTracking cookies will be detected and removed immediately. They are identified purely by their behaviour - no need for a blacklist that needs to be kept up to-date. Self-Destructing Cookies also has LocalStorage support and will treat it just like your cookie jar. Defend yourself against ETag tracking and other cache-based black-hat techniques by configuring Self-Destructing Cookies to automatically clean your cache every time you are not actively using the browser. For the first time ever, this provides a realistic chance of beating zombie-/evercookies without sacrificing usability. See the zombie-cookie FAQ entry for details. Self-Destructing Cookies can also help protect against CSRF attacks by ending your sessions as soon as possible.\n\nThis add-on complements blacklist-based solutions such as Adblock and Ghostery very well. You can whitelist sites whose cookies and LocalStorage you would like to keep without an active tab in the Firefox cookie exception list, which can also be conveniently accessed from the add-on's preferences, or an icon in the Add-on Bar.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions and Common Problems\n\nQ: Will this add-on ever be multi-process (e10s) compatible?\nA: Add-ons can't monitor sites' LocalStorage usage in e10s mode. This functionality will probably never be restored for legacy add-ons such as SDC. This means that the answer is \"very likely never\". You can still force-enable e10s and SDC should clean your cookies just fine, but it can only clean your LocalStorage when the browser starts.\n\nQ: Will this add-on make the jump to the WebExtension world?\nA: I don't have the time for a full rewrite as a WebExtension. Enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nQ: What about Zombie-/Evercookies?\nA: SDC gives you a fighting chance against such black-hat techniques. To beat the Evercookie, enable automatic cache cleaning in SDC's preferences. If you are on a decent, unmetered connection, there is no harm in setting the idle timeout to a low value, such as 3 minutes. You should also set all of your plugins to click-to-play, install BetterPrivacy and configure it to automatically clean unused LSOs. Please note that SDC will not clean LocalStorage scopes of sites served via HTTPS if you are running a Firefox version prior to 23. This is due to a limitation in Firefox's DOM storage API in those versions.\n\nQ: Can I disable the notification pop-ups?\nA: Yes. Open the add-on manager. You can reach it via Firefox's menu, or by just entering \"about:addons\" without the quotes in your location bar. Locate Self-Destructing Cookies in your list of extensions, click the Preferences button and remove the checkmark next to \"Notifications\".\n\nQ: Since I installed the add-on, the removal notifications just won't stop. I'm not even using the browser at the moment.\nA: You are probably using another add-on that re-adds certain cookies when they are removed, e.g. Beef Taco or TrackerBlock which both try to persist opt-out cookies. SDC and the other add-on are having an infinite debate about whether to keep those cookies. Choose a side and disable the other one.\n\nQ: The entire whitelist is empty each time I restart Firefox.\nA: You probably have Firefox's privacy preferences set to \"Clear History when Firefox closes\" and included \"Site Preferences\" in the corresponding menu. SDC's whitelist is stored as site preferences.\n\nQ: A specific site forgets my login, even though it is on my whitelist.\nIf you added the entries manually, make sure you whitelisted the base domains of your sites (e.g. \"example.com\", not \"www.example.com\"). That's where cookies are generally stored.\nIf you added it via the icon, the login might depend on external domains. Keep an eye on the removal notifications the next time you log *in* there. The domains that appear in the following seconds are probably the ones you want on your whitelist as well.\n\nQ: The add-on does not work in private browsing mode.\nA: Some parts of Firefox are off-limits for add-ons while you are in private browsing mode. This includes the cookie jar for example. There's nothing I can do about this, sorry.\n\nQ: I have configured Firefox to block all cookies by default. Can I still use SDC?\nA: There is an unsupported hidden setting that changes the behaviour of the \"yellow\" whitelist level from allow-for-session to allow-while-open. To enable it, create a boolean key in your about:config named \"extensions.jid0-9XfBwUWnvPx4wWsfBWMCm4Jj69E@jetpack.defaultBlock\" (without the quotes), set it to true and restart your browser. You can now use the \"yellow\" setting for sites whose cookies you would like to accept, but still have them self-destruct. I provide this on a \"should work\" basis, meaning that I depend on bug reports from you and don't do in-depth testing of this mode myself.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/98/98894.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","width":"650","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/98/98894.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","thumbnailWidth":"186","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Gets rid of a site's cookies as soon as you close its last tab."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/98/98896.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","width":"587","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/98/98896.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","thumbnailWidth":"168","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Detects and removes trackers without the need for a blacklist - purely by their behaviour.

If you have Firefox version 51 and above, please use this version instead. It is more robust and has better performance comparing to the addon-sdk version.\n\nSmart HTTPS is a Firefox addon that helps you always use the secure HTTPS protocol, if supported by the server. It automatically changes HTTP protocol to the secure HTTPS, and if loading encounters error, reverts it back to the HTTP protocol.\n\nHTTP vs. HTTPS:\nHTTP, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol, is the way a server communicates with the browser. HTTP enables visitors to view a website and send information back and forth to the server. HTTPS, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure, is communication through a secured connection. Communications through an HTTPS with the server are encrypted by a secure certificate known as an SSL. The encryption prevents third-parties from eavesdropping on all communications to and from the server. Read more about HTTPS at the Addon's Homepage.\n\nSome Key Features:\na. Seamlessly changes all HTTP requests to the secure HTTPS, and if an error occurs, reverts it back to the HTTP address (and remembers this choice).\nb. All websites (addresses) that do not support HTTPS, are saved to memory in order to speedup the protocol-check process. Note that you can see and delete these items from the Addon's Options page.\nc. Toolbar button serves as the ON-OFF switch to turn the extension ON or OFF. Blue color indicates ON state and Gray color is for OFF state.\nd. (v0.1.2) You can now add desired websites to the white-list manually (see Addon's options page).\n\nA Sample Scenario (based on a question from a user):\nWhen you install the Addon for the first time, you will visit its support page. Since this page does not support HTTPS protocol; the Addon first loads the address in HTTPS, and when it sees the error (it this case the error is the Firefox’s certificate-error page) reverts the address back to HTTP. But this operation is so fast that you will not see the error page at all. However, it is available in the browser’s log (or history) if you check. In simple words, SMART HTTPS’s procedure is as following:\n\nFor any HTTP address, loads the page in HTTPS >>> watch for any sort or ERROR page (such as cert-error, blank-page, not-found-page, etc.) >>> reverts the page back to HTTP\n\nFurthermore, SMART HTTPS only monitors HTTP websites and does not have any effect on HTTPS addresses at all. The behavior of SMART HTTPS is very similar to what human does to check for HTTPS protocol. You first change an HTTP address to HTTPS and if you see any errors happening, you will change the address back to HTTP. This is exactly what SMART HTTPS does, but in a much faster manner. This Addon is also available for Google Chrome and Opera browsers and has exactly the same behavior in three browsers.\n\nNote: in order to report Bugs, please visit Addon's Homepage and fill the Bug report form.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/170/170268.png?src=api&modified=1465044816","width":"440","height":"280","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/170/170268.png?src=api&modified=1465044816","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"127"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/162/162074.png?src=api&modified=1465044816","width":"700","height":"438","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/162/162074.png?src=api&modified=1465044816","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Smart HTTPS Active vs. Inactive"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/174/174887.png?src=api&modified=1465044816","width":"700","height":"410","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174887.png?src=api&modified=1465044816","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"117","caption":"panel UI (v 0.1.4)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/170/170267.png?src=api&modified=1465044816","width":"700","height":"438","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/170/170267.png?src=api&modified=1465044816","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Options Page (v0.1.2)"}],"homepageURL":"http://mybrowseraddon.com/smart-https.html","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/smart-https/?src=api","supportURL":"http://mybrowseraddon.com/smart-https.html","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":26,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/smart-https/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":450108,"weeklyDownloads":1193,"dailyUsers":25949,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/513702/smart_https-0.1.8-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":153077,"updateDate":1475568618000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"@canvas-shadow","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/687/687198-32.png?modified=1470619217","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/687/687198-64.png?modified=1470619217"},"type":"extension","name":"Canvas Defender","version":"1.1.0","creator":{"name":"Multiloginapp","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/anonymous-a30a93440f6f03abfd1404e2e0d869fc/?src=api"},"description":"Instead of completely blocking canvas fingerprinting, Canvas Defender add-on creates a unique and persistent noise that hides your real canvas fingerprint.

Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Unified logger"}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/android/addon/ublock-origin/?src=api","supportURL":"https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/support-ublock-origin/6746","averageRating":5,"reviewCount":1870,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/android/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":26238569,"weeklyDownloads":426091,"dailyUsers":3862985,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/android/downloads/file/672156/ublock_origin-1.13.4-an+fx+sm+tb.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":1725207,"updateDate":1498564720000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"rest-easy@quickmediasolutions.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/470/470881-32.png?modified=1437760785","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/470/470881-64.png?modified=1437760785"},"type":"extension","name":"REST Easy","version":"0.3.1.1-signed","creator":{"name":"Nathan Osman","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/nathan-osman/?src=api"},"description":"A simple REST client for Firefox","fullDescription":"REST Easy is a Firefox add-on that provides a full-featured REST client in the browser.

Everything can be disabled.\n    Easy for beginners, powerful for advanced users. Not just for Vim fanatics.\n    Modeled after Vimium for Chrome.\n\nNew to VimFx? Check out Questions & Answers!\nPower user? Make a config file!\nIn either case, have look at the the documentation and the wiki.\nAlso check out the future of VimFx.\n\nVimFx is made by these awesome people.\n\nWhy VimFx was created\n\n    Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion, Vimperator has too many features and aggressively changes the default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium is exactly what I need in terms of added functionality, but for Chrome. That’s why I decided to develop a similar extension for Firefox.\n\n     VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.\n\n    – Anton Khodakivskiy, VimFx’s original author.\n\n\nKey Features\nVimFx has concise shortcuts for most commonly performed actions. Many simply invoke standard Firefox features. That is preferred over re-implementing similar functionality.\n\nPress f to mark links, text inputs and buttons on the page. Then either type the hint or the text of a marked element to click it. This command has many variations, for example to copy links or open them in new tabs.\n\nSearch with / and cycle between matches with n and N.\n\nOpen a new tab with t, close it with x. Reopen it again with X. Switch between tabs with J and K, or some of the several other tab commands.\n\nScrolling left/down/up/right: h, j, k, l.\nTop/Bottom: gg, G.\nPage up/down: space, shift-space.\nHalf a page: d, u.\n\nUse Caret mode to copy text without using the mouse.\n\nThere are of course many more shortcuts! Press ? to see them all, and then / to search among them. Click on a command or open VimFx’s options page in the Add-ons Manager to customize the default shortcuts.\n\nYou can temporarily disable VimFx by using Ignore mode. Press i to enter it, and shift-escape to exit. Use the blacklist to automatically enter Ignore mode on specific sites.\n\nThere’s also an article on ghacks.net which is a good introduction.\n\nFeedback\nEnjoying VimFx?
