If so, then read carefully before filing any issue.\n\n***\n\nAn efficient blocker: easy on memory and CPU footprint, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.\n\nIllustrated overview of its efficiency: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-vs.-ABP:-efficiency-compared\n\nUsage: The big power button in the popup is to permanently disable/enable uBlock for the current web site. It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Unified logger"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/812203/ublock_origin-1.14.22-an+fx.xpi?src=api","size":1832971,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":4081,"totalDownloads":38405509,"weeklyDownloads":516250,"dailyUsers":4549525,"updateDate":1513270812000,"supportURL":"https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/support-ublock-origin/6746"},{"id":"{7a7a4a92-a2a0-41d1-9fd7-1e92480d612d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-32.png?modified=1515518753","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-64.png?modified=1515518753"},"name":"Stylus","type":"extension","version":"1.1.7.8","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/openstyles/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/j_schomery/?src=api"}],"description":"Redesign the web with Stylus, a user styles manager.

Also note that you need the legacy version of Stylish which is 2.x.x.\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround.\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?src=api&modified=1494762140","width":"700","height":"438","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.png?src=api&modified=1494762140","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?src=api&modified=1494762140","width":"700","height":"517","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.png?src=api&modified=1494762140","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"148"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://add0n.com/stylus.html","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/806334/stylus_beta-1.1.7.8-an+fx.xpi?src=api","size":1084220,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":129,"totalDownloads":87027,"weeklyDownloads":1696,"dailyUsers":25925,"updateDate":1512845411000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues"},{"id":"jid0-RwTySlpoKU14fw7yw2AflOAihhA@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/411/411216-32.png?modified=1501143621","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/411/411216-64.png?modified=1501143621"},"name":"QR Code Image Generator","type":"extension","version":"3.0.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"webdev7","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/webdev7/?src=api"},"description":"Create a QR code of the selected text, current url or hyperlink.

Some of the most common digital currencies are, Litecoin, Ethereum, Zcash, Ripple, Monero and Bitcoin. There are some companies that offer crypto-currency mining tools for embedding in websites.
